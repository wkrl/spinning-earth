# Spinning Earth GIF

A small tool to create gifs of the earth rotating on any given day. Imagery is based on [NASA's EPIC API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#EPIC).

Create a config.py file and set the value of token equal to your API token. Alternatively you can use 'DEMO_KEY'.

Make sure to install the imageio library.
